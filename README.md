# FileSharing

## Cloud-based files can now be shared easily by anyone, thanks to the internet. Everyone knows how to share files. With an online file-sharing service, 
you can store and access files like documents, data, photos, and videos in the cloud instead of on your device's hard drive or removable media.
Google Drive, Dropbox, MediaFire, FileShare, Amazon Drive, and Jumpshare are well-known file-sharing services. The problem with the way file-sharing 
works now is that these one-click hosting services are often used to share content that is protected by intellectual property rights without the 
owner's permission. Since there are so many file hosting services, a distributed blocklist might be useful to stop a file that was removed from one 
service from being uploaded to another. To solve this problem, we are making a prototype of a web file-sharing service as a web application.
